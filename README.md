# Reqon Ruleset

Reqon is a fork of *[Request Control](https://github.com/tumpio/requestcontrol)*,
an extension to control HTTP requests. Provides front-end for Firefox
[webRequest.onBeforeRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/onBeforeRequest)
API for HTTP request management.

This repository contains additional rules which you can subscribe in the `Import` tab since (unreleased) version 1.16.0a1 of *Request Control* and all versions of *Reqon*.

You can find a few examples in [rule](./rules/) and the `Import` tab of Reqon extension.
The exported config *per se* is also a valid example, you can just crop all others and share a single rule.
